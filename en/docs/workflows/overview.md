# Durable Workflows

Most integrations start simple and end up long-lived: an order needs a manager's approval, a claim waits days for supporting documents, a payment needs a retry after a gateway hiccup. A normal program loses everything when the process restarts — a **durable workflow does not**.

WSO2 Integrator lets you design workflows that:

- **Survive crashes and restarts** — every completed step is recorded, and the workflow resumes exactly where it left off. A finished step is never re-executed.
- **Wait for as long as it takes** — pause for hours, days, or months for a human decision or an external event, consuming no threads or memory while suspended.
- **Recover from failures** — retry failed steps automatically, or hand the failure to a human who can fix the input and retry.
- **Keep humans in the loop** — assign role-based tasks that people decide from the [Integration Control Plane](icp/managing-workflows.md) task inbox.

## Two ways to build, one durable runtime

| Durable Workflow | Durable Agentic Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| You wire the steps together in a visual flow | You describe the goal; an AI model decides the steps |
| Explicit, predictable path | Adapts to each request at runtime |
| Best for known, fixed business logic | Best for branchy, hard-to-enumerate logic |

Both run on the same durable runtime, so an AI agent gets crash-safety, human tasks, timers, and retries for free.

## Getting started

- **[Build a Claim Handling Agent](getting-started/build-a-claim-workflow-agent.md):** Your first durable agentic workflow — an agent that validates expense claims and pays them out only after a manager approves.

## Workflow features

- **[Transaction workflows](develop/transaction-workflow.md):** Wire activities into a reliable, crash-safe flow with automatic retries.
- **[Human task workflows](develop/human-task-workflow.md):** Pause for role-based human decisions and external data, for as long as it takes.
- **[Review activities and error handling](develop/review-activity-and-error-handling.md):** Approval gates before risky steps and human-reviewed retries after failures.
- **[Durable agentic workflows](develop/durable-agentic-workflow.md):** AI agents with durable activities, events, human tasks, and agent-to-agent collaboration.

## Manage running workflows

- **[Integration Control Plane](icp/managing-workflows.md):** See every workflow instance, where it is halted, decide human tasks and reviews, and suspend, resume, or terminate runs.

## Tutorials

- **[Tutorials](tutorials/overview.md):** Complete, step-by-step examples for each workflow feature.

## Reference

- **[Management API](reference/management-api.md):** The REST API behind the Control Plane — list instances, read execution graphs, and complete tasks programmatically.
